<h1 align="center">Yo-kai Watch Info</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built webapp showing information about your favorite yo-kai.</h3>



### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###

#### Some Notes:

- Only Yo-kai that were released as part of the 'normal' medal range are currently included

- I plan to add more information about each Yo-kai as I am able

- If you haven't watched Yo-kai Watch you're really missing out. Check it out on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80106136)

#### Tech Stuff:

- This webapp was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

- Though I've been working with a frontend JavaScript stack for a while now, I'm constantly learning. I implemented a modal image effect on the thumbnails for this page, which I haven't had occasion to learn before.

#### Improvements/Optimizations coming:

- **Next up:** I am going to add a dropdown list so Yo-Kai can be selected without having to know their names by heart

- **Future feature ideas**

  - Ability to show a selection of Yo-Kai based on various filters (tribe, etc.)
  - A 'show all' option with view options (Yo-kai thumbnail, names, Medal thumbnail, etc.)
  - Integrate a 'close enough' spell-checker to find misspelled Yo-kai

### :star: Try it Out
